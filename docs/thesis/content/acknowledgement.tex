\chapter{Acknowledgement} \label{acknowledgements}

I would like to thank and give my best regards to my supervisors, Gábor Sörös and Judit Tevesz for their valuable insights throughout the development of this thesis. Their encouragement and expert advice have been invaluable in overcoming challenges and achieving my goals.

I wish to thank Nokia Bell Labs for providing me the opportunity to work on their mobile robot and for lending me an OAK-D camera with which I could experiment and implement my features at home.

My sincere thanks also go to the Spectacular AI Team, particularly Jerry Ylilammi for generously providing access to their SDK for the Raspberry Pi 4 for educational purposes. Their support allowed me to explore advanced technologies and implement key components of this project.
