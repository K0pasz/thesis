\chapter{Experiments with OAK-D} \label{experiments_oak_d}

\section{Overview}

%In this chapter, we present the design and implementation of our solution, focusing on visual mapping and 3D reconstruction. The experiments and methodologies employed in this thesis aim to evaluate the performance and capabilities of various tools and techniques for real-time mapping and object detection.

In this chapter we explore the capabilities of the OAK-D camera using the DepthAI Viewer software to understand its functionalities. This exploration provided insights into the camera's real-time 3D reconstruction and its Vision Processing Unit (VPU) capabilities. Subsequently, we experimented with the Spectacular AI SDK to further test the camera's performance, especially in mapping and person detection scenarios.

%%% Overall, this chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the experimental design, methodologies, and outcomes of our efforts to develop an effective solution for real-time mapping and 3D reconstruction using state-of-the-art technologies.

\section{Experimenting with DepthAI}

To begin exploring the capabilities of the camera, I initiated my efforts by testing the example software provided by the camera's manufacturer, namely DepthAI Viewer\footnote{\url{https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-viewer}}. This software proved invaluable for its ability to showcase the camera's functionalities effectively.

Upon installation, I gained access to a user-friendly interface that allowed me to view images captured by the camera in real-time. Additionally, the software facilitated real-time 3D reconstruction of the camera's surroundings, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:DAI_3d}. Notably, the DepthAI Viewer leveraged the Vision Processing Unit (VPU) embedded within the device, thereby enabling comprehensive exploration of its capabilities, as illustrated in the top left corner of Figure~\ref{fig:DAI_person_detection}.

\end{figure}

This initial exploration served as a foundational step in understanding the camera's capabilities and paved the way for further experimentation and development in subsequent tasks.

\section{Experimenting with Spectacular AI}

The next step was to experiment with the Spectacular AI SDK's examples to determine if it is capable of mapping and detecting persons with low latency. At first the Python scripts threw a warning and they did not work: 
\FloatBarrier
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,frame=single,float=h]
SpectacularAI WARN: Dropping frames!
SpectacularAI WARN: VIO may be running too slow, data is being input too fast, or IMU samples are missing / time-offset from frames. (buffer size 10)
\end{lstlisting}
After some research I found out that this problem is related to outdated firmware version on the camera (note that it took a long time to find the solution due to the severe lack of documentation). To solve the issue, Luxonis' \verb|depthai-python| repo\footnote{\url{https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python}} must be cloned and the IMU firmware update script\footnote{\url{https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python/blob/main/examples/IMU/imu_firmware_update.py}} must be ran. After the successful firmware update I was able to try out the examples.

The most simple is the one that visualizes the camera's movement. It extracts the data from the IMU and uses matplotlib for visualization. As we can see on Figure \ref{fig:IMU_visu}, I was able to draw a heart in the air. The curves are not perfect because my hand was probably shaking a bit.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=150mm, keepaspectratio]{figures/spectacular_ai_vio_visu.png}
	\caption{IMU visualization with Spectacular AI}
	\label{fig:IMU_visu}
\end{figure}

A bit more advanced example uses the camera too, not just the IMU. When the camera is covered with our hand it visualizes the device's movement with the help of the IMU as we can see on Figure \ref{fig:3d_pen}.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=150mm, keepaspectratio]{figures/3d_pen.png}
	\caption{IMU visualization with Spectacular AI}
	\label{fig:3d_pen}
\end{figure}

These examples just visualized the camera's movement and the picture taken with the camera so we did not see any mapping or person detection yet. The repository fortunately provides some spectacular examples on these applications too. However these examples always raised an error which had to be debugged. These examples use OpenGL for visualization and the problem stood in some deep OpenGL code. The easiest way to solve this problem was to comment out some code in \verb|OpenGL/contexdata.py|:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=python,frame=single,float=!ht]
def getContext( context = None ):
    """Get the context (if passed, just return)
    context -- the context ID, if None, the current context
    """
    if context is None:
        context = platform.GetCurrentContext()
    # if context == 0:
        # from OpenGL import errorS
        # raise error.Error(
        # """Attempt to retrieve context when no valid context"""
        # )
    return context
\end{lstlisting}
\FloatBarrier

I understand that it is not the best approach for handling an error like this but it was the least time consuming solution.

Once we digested my absolutely wonderful problem solving technique, we can continue with the examples. We can try out some mapping applications, such as point cloud mapping (Figure~\ref{fig:SPAI_mapping}), real-time AR mapping with mesh (Figure~\ref{fig:SPAI_mesh_mapping}), real-time AR mapping with point cloud (Figure~\ref{fig:SPAI_point_cloud_mapping}) and mapping with ROS2 integration (Figure~\ref{fig:SPAI_ros_mapping}).

	\caption{ROS2 mapping with Spectacular AI}

\end{figure}

As we can see the Spectacular AI SDK works really well with the OAK camera. During the testing of the examples I could not experience any major latencies so we can safely say that it works real-time.

I saved the most exciting example for the last one of each. As I said earlier the camera contains a VPU (Intel Movidius Myriad X\footnote{\url{https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/204770/intel-movidius-myriad-x-vision-processing-unit-0gb/specifications.html}}) which can run neural network models. We do not have to make any post-processing or post-detecting with neural networks because it can be ran on the camera itself. Thanks to the stereo cameras and the VPU OAK is able to detect objects and calculate their location on-the-fly. To select what type of objects we want to detect we have to modify the example code (we only have to modify one list). As we can see on Figure~\ref{fig:SPAI_depthai}, I customised the code to detect potted plants in the living room. Due to inadequate lighting the detections did not perform 100\% but they are absolutely acceptable. Moreover I measured the positions of the plants myself and I can safely say that the camera calculated the distances really accurately.
