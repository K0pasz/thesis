# Mapping using Spectacular AI

2 workspaces can be found in this directory:

- `turtlebot_ws/`: ROS2 workspace for mapping with Spectacular AI using OAK-D or OAK-D Pro camera
- `laptop_ws/`: ROS2 workspace for visualizing the mapping with RViz and collecting keyframes for Gaussian Splatting

For the usage of these workspaces see `README.md` in `turtlebot_ws` and `laptop_ws`.
